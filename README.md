# StellarRent

## Empowering Global Rentals

Traditional rental platforms like Airbnb and real estate agencies impose high fees (7%-20%), slow payment processing (1-7 days), and lack transparency, often excluding small property owners and tenants in emerging markets. StellarRent aims to solve this by providing a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) rental platform built on the Stellar blockchain, enabling secure, transparent, and cost-efficient rentals for everyone.

We believe that **everyone** deserves access to a fair rental marketplace with **minimal fees**, **instant payments**, and **complete transparency**, powered by blockchain technology.

Leveraging Stellar's fast transactions (3-5 seconds), near-zero fees (~$0.000001), and Soroban smart contracts, StellarRent abstracts the complexity of blockchain into a user-friendly experience for property owners and tenants worldwide.

## Codebase

This monorepo contains the full stack for StellarRent, including the frontend, backend, and smart contracts.

### Core Architecture Design

StellarRent connects property owners and tenants through a decentralized platform on Stellar. Owners list properties via a Soroban smart contract, tenants pay with USDC, and payments are secured in an escrow contract until the rental conditions are met. All transactions are recorded on Stellar's public ledger for transparency.

### Core Operations

### Current Development State

StellarRent is under active development. Contributions are welcome!

We are currently building a minimal prototype, focusing on the essential features:

- Listing properties on Testnet using Soroban smart contracts.
- Renting properties with USDC payments.
- Securing payments with a basic escrow system.

The project uses:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS for a user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with Supabase for user authentication and data management.
- **Smart Contracts**: Soroban on Stellar for decentralized rental logic.

## Try It Out

A quick tutorial on how to run the project locally is available in [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md).

## üê≥ Docker Setup

StellarRent backend now supports Docker for consistent development and deployment across environments.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10 or higher)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 2.0 or higher)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the backend:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stellar-Rent/stellar-rent.git
   cd stellar-rent/apps/backend
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values (Supabase credentials, JWT secret, etc.)
   ```

3. **Start the development environment:**

   ```bash
   npm run docker:dev
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with hot-reloading enabled.

### Docker Commands

| Command                | Description                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run docker:build` | Build the Docker image                           |
| `npm run docker:dev`   | Start development environment with hot-reloading |
| `npm run docker:prod`  | Start production environment                     |
| `npm run docker:stop`  | Stop all containers                              |
| `npm run docker:logs`  | View backend logs                                |
| `npm run docker:shell` | Access container shell                           |
| `npm run docker:test`  | Run tests inside container                       |
| `npm run docker:clean` | Remove all containers and images                 |

### Environment Configuration

The Docker setup uses the same environment variables as the local setup. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

- **SUPABASE_URL**: Your Supabase project URL
- **SUPABASE_ANON_KEY**: Supabase anonymous key
- **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY**: Supabase service role key
- **JWT_SECRET**: Secret for JWT token signing
- **STELLAR_NETWORK**: `testnet` for development, `mainnet` for production

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

```bash
npm run docker:prod:detached
```

This starts the backend with:

- Optimized production build
- Security hardening
- Resource limits
- Health checks
- Redis caching

### Troubleshooting

- **Port conflicts**: Ensure port 3000 is not in use
- **Environment variables**: Verify all required variables are set in `.env`
- **Docker logs**: Check logs with `docker logs <container-name>`
- **Container health**: Use `docker ps` to verify containers are running
- **Build issues**: Try `npm run docker:clean` and rebuild
- **Running tests**: Execute tests inside the container with `docker exec -it <container-name> npm run test`
